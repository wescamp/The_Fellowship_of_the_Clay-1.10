#define STR_ELVISH_MARSHAL_DESCRIPTION
_"The longevity and natural intelligence of elves make them apt for military matters, enough even to counter their general distaste for war. Elves remember things much more clearly than humankind, and can often intuit what others can only be trained to do. Certainly, on those rare occasions when an elf sets his mind to war, the strategy that results is often the work of a master." #enddef

#define STR_ELVISH_CHAMPION_DESCRIPTION
_"Those few elves who deliberately hone themselves into weapons of war become something which belies the peace-loving reputation of their race. Dedication and skill are matched with purity of form, and the result is swordsmanship to which few can compare. Even their archery, treated as a secondary pursuit, is masterfully executed." #enddef

#define STR_ELVISH_LORD_DESCRIPTION
"The nobility of the elves are possessed of merit to match their standing in society. Elvish Lords are the wisest and strongest of their people, and are fearsome in their command of magic." #enddef

#define STR_GRYPHON_DESCRIPTION
"These majestic and powerful creatures are masters of the sky. Gryphons are both dangerous and wary of other intelligent creatures, and thus should not be disturbed without a good reason." #enddef
