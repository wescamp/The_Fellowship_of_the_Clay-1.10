I will keep this raven-statue right with me at my throne room. It should be the best guarded place and there in my line of sight, I shall remind me every day of the dangers that come with shortcuts."

Our sons and grandsons might be able to build a new great city that does not bear the burden of this one. But I do not want to be remembered as the King who left nothing but a cursed place. I still have some plans for that Ruby of Fire. I want it to be transformed into a scepter - a symbol that should represent the human's Kings power. And Clyde: This time, I will go myself and arrange an agreement with the dwarfs - you did already too much for me!"
